# Unified Worker Architecture: Location-Transparent Services

## Overview

This document set outlines the architectural design for unified worker management in the HSU Master system, enabling location-transparent services that can be deployed either as out-of-process workers or in-process modules with the same interface and lifecycle management.

## Problem Statement

Currently, services/modules in distributed systems must be designed differently depending on their deployment model:
- **Out-of-process**: Separate executables with process isolation and network communication
- **In-process**: Compiled/linked code with function calls and shared memory

This creates:
- **Development complexity**: Different code paths for different deployment scenarios
- **Operational overhead**: Different management approaches for process vs module deployment
- **Migration friction**: Difficulty switching between deployment models
- **Testing challenges**: Different test environments for different deployment types

## Vision: Location-Transparent Services

### Core Principle
Services should be designed **once** and deployed **anywhere** - the deployment decision (in-process vs out-of-process) should be a **configuration choice**, not a design constraint.

### Core Insight
**Deployment location should be a configuration decision, not a design constraint.**

The native module approach achieves this by:
1. **Compile-time Integration**: Modules are regular Go packages compiled into the binary
2. **Runtime Registration**: Simple factory pattern connects modules to Master
3. **Configuration-Driven**: YAML determines whether services run in-process or out-of-process
4. **Unified Management**: Same lifecycle, monitoring, and error handling for all worker types

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Location Transparency
- **Single Interface**: Same service interface regardless of deployment location
- **Unified Lifecycle**: Same start/stop/health operations for all worker types
- **Protocol Consistency**: Same communication protocols (gRPC, HTTP) for both deployments

### 2. Deployment Flexibility
- **Runtime Decision**: Choose deployment model via configuration
- **Either/Or Approach**: Simple binary choice - process OR module
- **No Hybrid Complexity**: Avoid complex mode-switching or fallback mechanisms

### 3. Acceptable Constraints
- **Shared Fate for Modules**: In-process modules can crash the Master (documented limitation)
- **No Resource Limits**: In-process modules cannot be resource-limited (like unmanaged workers)
- **Restart Required**: No hot-swapping; deployment changes require restart
- **Communication Scope**: Leave service-to-service communication protocols out of scope

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing process workers continue to work unchanged
- **Incremental Adoption**: Add module support without affecting existing functionality
- **Evolutionary Path**: Start simple, evolve based on real-world usage

## Quick Start

### For Module Authors
1. Implement the `WorkerModule` interface (4 simple methods)
2. Provide a factory function: `func NewMyService() worker.WorkerModule`
3. Use the same protocols (gRPC, HTTP) regardless of deployment

### For Application Authors  
1. Import modules as regular Go packages
2. Register factories at startup: `master.RegisterNativeModuleFactory("service", factory)`
3. Configure deployment via YAML: `type: "module"` or `type: "process"`

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **True Location Transparency**: Same service code works in-process or out-of-process
- ‚úÖ **Go-Idiomatic Development**: Just import packages and register factories
- ‚úÖ **Zero Complexity Overhead**: No dynamic loading, plugins, or special build requirements
- ‚úÖ **Operational Consistency**: Same Master APIs, monitoring, and lifecycle management

## Architecture Impact

**This architecture transforms HSU Master from a process manager into a unified service orchestrator that can elegantly handle both traditional process workers and modern in-process modules with the same simplicity and power.**
