1. time.Sleep in circuit breaker - needs wait with context
2. do we need to call Reset for circuit breaker on resource violation reset?
3. brainstorm on integrated units support:
   - currently they do not differ from managed unit
   - we could do health check calling gRPC/HTTP APIs for them (they are mandated to support either of) - should we?
   - we could enhance the log collection for attached case (currently not possible due to system restrictions), 
     e.g via special log streaming API
   - what else?
4. test/verify the unmanaged units support
