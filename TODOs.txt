1. time.Sleep in circuit breaker - needs wait with context
2. do we need to call Reset for circuit breaker on resource violation reset?
3. brainstorm on integrated units support:
   - currently they do not differ from managed unit
   - we could do health check calling gRPC/HTTP APIs for them (they are mandated to support either of) - should we?
   - we could enhance the log collection for attached case (currently not possible due to system restrictions), 
     e.g via special log streaming API
   - what else?
4. test/verify the unmanaged units support

------------ Code:
- split new diagnostic type from processcontrol/process_state.go into a separate file
- split structs from workerstatemachines/ single go file into a separate files

------------ More:
+ API to check worker executable file exists, worker spawn/restart status
- 2 concurrent masters
- worker dependencies
- parse worker logs from files
- metrics (Alerting Integration)
- worker configs in separate files (in well-known location?)

------------ Extra:
- download / install executable (is this hsu master features?)
- api managemeent (is this a separate API gateway's feature?)
