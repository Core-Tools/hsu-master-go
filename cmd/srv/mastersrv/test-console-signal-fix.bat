echo Testing Improved Windows Console Signal Fix
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo This test demonstrates the AttachConsole dead PID hack solution:
echo.
echo 🔧 THE MAGIC FIX:
echo 1. When worker dies, call AttachConsole(deadPID) before restart
echo 2. This triggers Windows console state reset
echo 3. Restores master's Ctrl+C functionality after restart cycles
echo.
echo 🛡️  SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS:
echo ✅ Process liveness detection before sending signals
echo ✅ Timeout protection prevents hanging
echo ✅ Proper error handling and logging
echo ✅ Thread-safe console operations
echo.
echo 📋 TEST PROCEDURE:
echo 1. Master starts with failing worker (no --port arg)
echo 2. Worker fails → console fix applied → worker restarts
echo 3. Repeat until circuit breaker opens (2 attempts max)
echo 4. Test Ctrl+C at ANY point - should work immediately
echo.
echo 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
echo ✅ See "🔧 Applying console signal fix using dead PID X"
echo ✅ See "📡 Sending Ctrl+Break to alive process PID Y" 
echo ✅ Circuit breaker opens after 2 restart attempts
echo ✅ Ctrl+C works immediately with "Received signal: interrupt"
echo ✅ Clean shutdown of all processes
echo.
echo 🚨 WHAT TO WATCH FOR:
echo • "🔧 Applying console signal fix" = Dead PID hack working
echo • "⏭️  Skipping signal to dead process" = Safety check working
echo • "⚠️  Warning: AttachConsole unexpectedly succeeded" = Unexpected behavior
echo • Timeout errors = Console operation hanging (should not happen)
