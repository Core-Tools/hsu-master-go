├── 🎯 master/       - Main orchestration and configuration
├── 👷 workers/      - Worker lifecycle and management  
├── ⚙️  process/      - Cross-platform process control
├── 📊 monitoring/   - Health checks and restart policies
├── 📁 processfile/  - PID and process file management
├── 🔍 processstate/ - Process liveness detection utilities

├── 🔗 generated/   - Protocol buffer generated code
└── 📜 domain/       - Business contract definitions
```

### **Dependency Flow Analysis**

The package dependency graph shows **excellent hierarchical design** with no circular dependencies:

```
main.go → pkg/master → pkg/workers → {pkg/process, pkg/monitoring, pkg/processfile}
                    → pkg/errors, pkg/logging (shared utilities)
```

---

## 🏗️ **Architectural Strengths**

### ✅ **1. Exceptional Separation of Concerns**

**Before**: Single monolithic `domain` package handling everything
**After**: Clean separation by responsibility:

- **`pkg/master`**: High-level orchestration, configuration, and worker lifecycle
- **`pkg/workers`**: Worker implementations and process control abstraction  
- **`pkg/process`**: Pure process execution and attachment logic
- **`pkg/monitoring`**: Health monitoring and restart policies
- **`pkg/processfile`**: File system operations and PID management

**Impact**: Each package now has a **single, clear responsibility** making the codebase significantly easier to understand and maintain.

### ✅ **2. Outstanding Dependency Management**

**Dependency Inversion**: Lower-level packages (`process`, `monitoring`) do not depend on higher-level packages (`master`, `workers`)

**Shared Utilities**: `errors` and `logging` packages provide consistent cross-cutting concerns without creating coupling

**No Circular Dependencies**: Clean dependency tree enables independent testing and development

### ✅ **3. Excellent Interface Design** 

**Worker Abstraction**:
```go
type Worker interface {
    ID() string
    Metadata() UnitMetadata
    ProcessControlOptions() ProcessControlOptions
}
```

**ProcessControl Interface**:
```go
type ProcessControl interface {
    Process() *os.Process
    HealthMonitor() monitoring.HealthMonitor
    Stdout() io.ReadCloser
    Start(ctx context.Context) error
    Stop(ctx context.Context) error
    Restart(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

**Benefits**: Minimal, focused interfaces enable easy testing, mocking, and future extensibility.

### ✅ **4. Superior Error Handling Architecture**

**Centralized Error Types**: `pkg/errors` provides structured error handling with rich context:

```go
type DomainError struct {
    Type    ErrorType
    Message string
    Cause   error
    Context map[string]interface{}
}
```

**Consistent Usage**: All packages use the same error patterns, improving debugging and operational visibility.

### ✅ **5. Modular Configuration System**

**Master Configuration**: `pkg/master/config.go` provides comprehensive YAML-based configuration
**Worker Types**: Each worker type has its own configuration structure with proper YAML tags
**Validation**: Built-in validation with helpful error messages

---

## 🎯 **Package-by-Package Analysis**

## 🎯 **Identified Areas for Further Improvement**

### **🔄 1. Package Boundary Refinements**

#### **`pkg/workers` Package Complexity**
- **Current**: Contains both worker implementations AND `ProcessControl` interface
- **Observation**: `ProcessControl` is used by workers but could be its own package
- **Suggestion**: Consider `pkg/processcontrol` to reduce `workers` package complexity

#### **`pkg/process` vs `pkg/processfile` Boundary**
- **Assessment**: ✅ **Current boundary is excellent** - keep as is

### **🔄 2. Configuration Architecture**

#### **Configuration Spread Across Packages**
- **Current**: Configuration structs in multiple packages with YAML tags
- **Trade-off**: Isolation (pro) vs Centralization (con)
- **Suggestion**: Consider hybrid approach with centralized validation

#### **YAML Tag Management**
- **Assessment**: ✅ **Perfect approach** - keeps configuration close to domain objects

### **🔄 3. Monitoring Package Expansion**

#### **Health Check vs Restart Logic**
- **Current**: Both health checks and restart policies in `pkg/monitoring`
- **Observation**: Could be split into `pkg/health` and `pkg/restart`
- **Assessment**: Split only if package grows significantly

### **🔄 4. Circuit Breaker Placement**

#### **Current Location**
- **Current**: Circuit breaker logic mixed with restart policies
- **Options**: Separate package, monitoring package, or keep with restart
- **Recommendation**: Keep with restart logic (related functionality)

---

## 📋 **Recommendations for Package Boundaries**

### **✅ Keep Current Boundaries** (These are excellent):

1. **`pkg/master`** - Perfect for high-level orchestration
2. **`pkg/errors`** - Excellent shared error handling
3. **`pkg/logging`** - Clean logging abstraction
4. **`pkg/processstate`** - Focused on single responsibility
5. **`pkg/generated`** - Standard location for generated code

### **🤔 Consider Minor Adjustments**:

1. **`pkg/workers`** - Consider splitting `ProcessControl` to own package if it grows
2. **`pkg/monitoring`** - Could split if health checks and restart logic grow independently
3. **`pkg/config`** - Consider hybrid centralized validation approach

### **🚫 Avoid These Changes**:

- Don't merge `pkg/process` and `pkg/processfile` - separation is excellent
- Don't merge `pkg/monitoring` and `pkg/workers` - different concerns
- Don't create `pkg/utils` or `pkg/common` - avoid utility packages
